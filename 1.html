<h1 style="font-size:100px;font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;text-align:center"><u>Free fire MAX</u></h1>
<p><b>Free Fire</b> is a battle royale game developed and published by Garena[2][3] for Android and iOS.[4] It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019.[5][6] As of 2021, Free Fire had surpassed 150 million daily active users.[7][8] Free Fire Max, a graphically enhanced version of Free Fire, was released globally on 28 September 2021</p>
<br>
<h2 ><b>Game play</b></h2>
<hr>
<p>In Free Fire, players control a character in a third-person perspective and use a joystick to move. The fire button allows them to shoot and throw items. The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, and lying down. During gameplay, players can utilize the "Gloo Wall" grenade as a form of cover to protect against damage</p>
<br>
<h2>Game modes</h2>
<br>
<p><i>Free Fire </i>offers over 15 game modes, including Team Deathmatch, Clash Squad, Big Head, Explosive Jump, Cold Steel, Rampage, and Pet Mania. However, modes other than Battle Royale, Clash Squad, and Lone Wolf are only available during special events.
<br><br>The <b>Battle Royale</b> mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without weapons. They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings. Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. There are 6 maps to choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. The mode allows for solo, duo, or squad play.
<br><br><b>Clash Squad</b> is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team. The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.
<br><br><b>Lone Wolf </b>is a variation of the Clash Squad mode that can be played as either a 1-player versus 1-player or 2-player versus 2-player "duo" format with more intricate rules. In each round, both sides have the opportunity to select their equipment for the next 2 rounds. The game is played in a best-of-5 format. If both teams have won 4 rounds each, a final round begins with both sides able to choose any weapon they prefer. All players are automatically equipped with basic items such as a vest and helmet from the start of the round. This mode takes place on its own map known as Iron Dome.
<br><br><b>Craftland</b> allows players to design their own maps in Free Fire using an in-game builder tool. The maps created can be shared and played with others. Craftland also supports script editing for advanced customization, giving creators greater freedom to bring their ideas to life. Players can add buildings, gameplay elements, and decorations to the map until they reach the maximum space limit. There are two maps available for players to use as the base for their designs.
<br>
<h2><b>Character system</b></h2><hr>
    <b><i>Free Fire</i></b> features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive. Active skills can be triggered manually by an in-game button and passive skills are triggered automatically. Each character can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive skills can be equipped by a single character).[24] Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with Cristiano Ronaldo,[25] Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,[26] A-Patroa from the collaboration with Anitta,[27] Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok[28] and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber.[29] In the game, all characters can be acquired for free through the Link system.
<br><h2>Pet system</h2><hr>
In Free Fire, pets can provide support to players during fights. As of 2023, the game features 21 different pets that players can choose to bring into battle. Each pet has a special ability that sets it apart from the others. Some of these abilities are passive and trigger automatically, while others are active and require manual activation. One of the pets in the game, Poring, was added as part of a collaboration with Ragnarok Online. Players can also customize their pets with skins and emotes.
